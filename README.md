## Usage

### Fluidd Interface

Once installed, you'll see an "Auto Power Off" panel in your Fluidd interface that allows you to:
- Enable/disable the auto power off feature
- See the countdown timer and current temperatures
- Manually start/cancel the power off timer
- Immediately power off the printer (with confirmation)

### Mainsail Interface

For Mainsail, you'll have access to:
- A set of GCODE commands to control auto power off
- A menu in the interface to access power off functions
- Configurable buttons to control the function (if you set up the GPIOs)

### GCODE Commands

The following GCODE commands are available:

- `AUTO_POWEROFF ON` - Globally enable the function
- `AUTO_POWEROFF OFF` - Globally disable the function
- `AUTO_POWEROFF START` - Manually start the timer
- `AUTO_POWEROFF CANCEL` - Cancel the current timer
- `AUTO_POWEROFF NOW` - Immediately power off the printer
- `AUTO_POWEROFF STATUS` - Display detailed status
- `AUTO_POWEROFF LANGUAGE VALUE=en` - Set language to English
- `AUTO_POWEROFF LANGUAGE VALUE=fr` - Set language to French
- `AUTO_POWEROFF DIAGNOSTIC VALUE=1` - Enable diagnostic mode for troubleshooting (0 to disable)
- `AUTO_POWEROFF DRYRUN VALUE=1` - Enable dry run mode which simulates power off (0 to disable)

### End G-code Integration

To enable auto power off only for specific prints, add this to your slicer's end G-code:

```
AUTO_POWEROFF ON  ; Enable auto power off
AUTO_POWEROFF START  ; Start the countdown timer
```

## Moonraker Integration (Advanced)

Auto Power Off can work in tandem with Moonraker's Power module to offer complete power control:

- **Auto Power Off** handles temperature-based and idle-timeout power off after a print
- **Moonraker Power** can handle power on before printing and support different power device types

This integration allows you to:
- Use SBC GPIO pins or different smart plug types
- Automatically power on the printer when a print is queued
- Automatically restart Klipper after power on
- Maintain protection against power off during printing

### Configuration

```markdown
1. **Configure the Power module in `moonraker.conf`**:

   ```ini
   [power printer]
   type: gpio                     # Device type: gpio, tplink_smartplug, tasmota, etc.
   pin: gpio27                    # For GPIO only: pin to use
   # address: 192.168.1.123       # For network devices: IP address
   off_when_shutdown: True
   initial_state: off
   on_when_job_queued: True       # Power on when a print is queued
   locked_while_printing: True
   restart_klipper_when_powered: True
   restart_delay: 3
   ```

   > **Important note**: In recent Moonraker versions, the `off_when_job_complete` option is no longer available. The Auto Power Off module handles this functionality, providing smart shutdown based on temperatures and idle timeout settings.
```

2. **Enable integration in `printer.cfg`**:

   ```ini
   [auto_power_off]
   idle_timeout: 600              # Idle time in seconds
   temp_threshold: 40             # Temperature threshold in 째C
   power_device: printer          # Must match name in [power printer]
   moonraker_integration: True    # Enable Moonraker integration
   moonraker_url: http://localhost:7125  # Moonraker API URL (optional)
   ```

```markdown
### Expected Behavior

1. When a print is queued, Moonraker powers on the printer.
2. Klipper automatically restarts after power on.
3. The printer cannot be powered off during printing (locked).
4. When the print is complete, Auto Power Off takes control and monitors:
   - The configured idle timeout
   - Hotend and bed temperatures
5. Once conditions are met, Auto Power Off powers off the printer.
```

### Supported Device Types

This integration works with all device types supported by Moonraker, including:
- GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi and other SBCs
- TP-Link Smart Plugs
- Tasmota, Shelly, HomeSeer devices
- And several other options...

See the [Moonraker documentation](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#power) for the complete list of options.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Power Device Not Found

If you see an error like "Power device 'psu_control' not found":

1. Make sure you have defined a `[power]` section in your Klipper configuration
2. Verify that the `power_device` parameter in `[auto_power_off]` matches the name in your `[power]` section
3. Check that the power device is properly configured and functional using `QUERY_POWER device_name`

#### Network Device Connectivity Issues

If using a network power device (like a smart plug) and having connectivity issues:

1. Verify you can ping the device from your Klipper host
2. Make sure you have set `network_device: True` and provided the correct `device_address`
3. Check firewall settings that might block communication

#### Testing with Dry Run Mode

To safely test the auto power off functionality without actually powering off your printer:

1. Enable dry run mode in your configuration: `dry_run_mode: True`
2. Or use the GCODE command: `AUTO_POWEROFF DRYRUN VALUE=1`
3. This will simulate power off and log all actions without actually powering off the printer

### Detailed Device Capability Diagnostics

To understand what capabilities your power device has:

1. Enable diagnostic mode: `AUTO_POWEROFF DIAGNOSTIC VALUE=1`
2. Check logs with: `tail -f /tmp/klippy.log | grep -i auto_power_off`
3. The logs will show what methods are available for your device
4. This helps troubleshoot why power off might not be working

### Compatible Devices

The module has been tested with the following power device types:

| Device Type | Compatibility | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi GPIO | Excellent | Direct control via GPIO pins |
| TP-Link Smart Plugs | Good | Requires network connectivity |
| Tasmota Devices | Good | Requires network connectivity |
| Shelly Devices | Good | Requires network connectivity |
| Smart Plugs via MQTT | Good | Requires Moonraker integration |
| USB Relay Boards | Good | When configured as GPIO devices |

## Advanced Usage

### Network Device Configuration

For network-based power devices (such as smart plugs), additional configuration is recommended:

```ini
[auto_power_off]
network_device: True  # Indicate this is a network device
device_address: 192.168.1.123  # IP address of your smart plug
network_test_attempts: 5  # Increase attempts for unreliable networks
network_test_interval: 2.0  # Wait 2 seconds between connection attempts
dry_run_mode: False  # Set to True initially for testing
```

This configuration enables connectivity testing before attempting to power off, improving reliability with network-based power devices.

## Language Support

This module is available in:
- English (default)
- French (see [README_FR.md](README_FR.md))

### Adding New Languages

The module now supports translations via external language files. To add a new language:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `auto_power_off_langs` directory named after the language code (e.g., `de.json` for German)
2. Copy the structure from an existing language file and translate all the messages
3. Add the new language code to the validation list in the `_configure_language` method
4. The new language will be available using `language: de` in configuration or via GCODE command
